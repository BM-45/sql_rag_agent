The LLM is sometimes writing integer to string for the dataset "b-mc2/sql-create-context" due to column names are very distinct is very vaguely defined.
I had to filter out very common table names due to which the retrieval accuracy increased.



Didnt implement it.
I need to add semantic layer and knowledge graph to the code(it might be good if we test for 3 tables with semantic layer added to it.)
I want to test the method not getting anything out of it.
